## ⚙️ Features

- 📸 Upload images (`.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.png`) for pothole detection
- 🎞️ Upload videos (`.mp4`, `.avi`, `.mov`) for frame-by-frame detection
- 🎥 Real-time pothole detection via webcam stream
- 🧠 YOLOv8 (Ultralytics) for deep learning-based object detection
- 💻 Clean, responsive UI built with Tailwind CSS
